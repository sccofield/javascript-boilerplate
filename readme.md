# Boilerplate for javascript React, Express Projects
A mostly unopinionated boiler plate for React, express projects. It provides the setup for compiling, linting and testing your code but doesn't make any further assumptions on how your project should be structured.

##Features
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) as the web framework.
- ES2017+ support with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).
- Linting with [ESLint](http://eslint.org/).
- bundling with [Webpack 4](https://webpack.js.org/)

## Getting started

```sh
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/sccofield/javascript-boilerplate
cd javascript-boilerplate

# Make it your own
rm -rf .git && git init && npm init

# Install dependencies
npm install

```

```sh
npm start
```

This will launch the project and you can view it on http://localhost:8000/ .


### Linting

Linting is set up using [ESLint](http://eslint.org/). It extends [airbnb's](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb) rules.
